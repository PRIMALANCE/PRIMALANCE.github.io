            <h2>USA</h2>
<p align="justify">
    <strong>USA</strong> is special to me because of its dominance in basketball, especially in the NBA. I’ve always admired the skill and athleticism of American basketball players, and watching an NBA game live would be a dream come true. The country has produced legends like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James, and its basketball culture is unlike any other. From street courts in New York to professional arenas like the Staples Center and Madison Square Garden, basketball is deeply embedded in American culture, making it an exciting place for any fan of the sport.

<p align="justify">
    <strong>To</strong> get there, I’d take a direct flight from Manila to major airports like Los Angeles (LAX), San Francisco (SFO), or New York (JFK), which usually takes around 13 to 16 hours. Once in the US, domestic flights, trains, and buses make it easy to travel between cities, while car rentals provide a great way to explore different states at my own pace.

<p align="justify">
    <strong>While</strong>  in the USA, my top priority would be watching an NBA game live, whether in Los Angeles, New York, or Miami. Aside from that, I’d love to visit famous landmarks like the Statue of Liberty, the Grand Canyon, and Hollywood. Exploring tech hubs like Silicon Valley, experiencing the vibrant streets of Times Square, and enjoying theme parks like Disneyland and Universal Studios would also be on my list. The USA is filled with exciting opportunities, and visiting it would be an unforgettable experience.
