            <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
<p align="justify">
    <sup><b>1</b></sup><strong>Hello,</strong> my name is Lance Robert Prima. 
    <sup><b>2</b></sup>I am currently a 2nd-year college student at the <b>University of the East Manila.</b> 
    <sup><b>3</b></sup>I was born on July 9, 2004, to parents Leus Anselmo Prima Sr. and Alegria C. Prima. 
    <sup><b>4</b></sup>I have four siblings—one sister and three brothers. 
    <sup><b>5</b></sup>I am the third child, which makes me the middle child. 
    <sup><b>6</b></sup>I was raised in Masbate, Philippines, where frequent electricity and water interruptions were part of daily life. 
    <sup><b>7</b></sup>Although I did not particularly enjoy my hometown, I found comfort in the company of friends who often visited me at home. 

    <sup><b>8</b></sup>I lived in a subdivision and made many friends there. 
    <sup><b>9</b></sup>Every afternoon, we would play in front of my house. 
    <sup><b>10</b></sup>Sometimes, we would run away from dogs for fun, climb mango trees, or play basketball. 
    <sup><b>11</b></sup>If we didn’t feel like going outside, we would just play video games at my house. 
    <sup><b>12</b></sup>From kindergarten until now, we have remained close friends, even though they are now far away. 
    <sup><b>13</b></sup>Despite the distance, we still find time to catch up and talk whenever we can. 

    <sup><b>14</b></sup>From an early age, I had many aspirations, such as becoming a lawyer, police officer, doctor, president, or engineer. 
    <sup><b>15</b></sup>My formal education began at Yadah Christian School, where I studied from preschool to grade 6. 
    <sup><b>16</b></sup>In Kinder 2, I was honored to graduate as the valedictorian. 
    <sup><b>17</b></sup>However, it was the third section, so yeah. 
    <sup><b>18</b></sup>I even had the opportunity to deliver a graduation speech. 
    <sup><b>19</b></sup>As I moved on to elementary school, I became overwhelmed by my intelligent classmates. 
    <sup><b>20</b></sup>My once strong work ethic faded, and I became less motivated.

            <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
<p align="justify">
    <sup><b>1</b></sup>And so, the time came when I entered high school, and I slowly lost my cheerful and energetic nature. 
    <sup><b>2</b></sup>I became very quiet because I wasn’t familiar with the people around me, and I only talked to a few people. 
    <sup><b>3</b></sup>Grade 9 was the best year of my high school life—I made a lot of friends. 
    <sup><b>4</b></sup>I found a circle of friends who became close to me, and even now, we’re still good friends. 
    <sup><b>5</b></sup>In case you’re wondering, they always invite me to play video games—literally every day. 
    <sup><b>6</b></sup>And of course, mischief was always part of the fun—those moments were truly unforgettable. 
    <sup><b>7</b></sup>Honestly, my house became our usual hangout spot since it was quite spacious, so we always ended up spending time there. 
    <sup><b>8</b></sup>Since we were in the same section, we naturally became very close. 
    <sup><b>9</b></sup>Most of the time, there were a lot of group activities that required us to practice until late in the evening. 
    <sup><b>10</b></sup>It was mostly dancing performances and speech choir that we had to prepare for, so we spent a lot of time together. 

    <sup><b>11</b></sup>One time, we even ended up staying until 9 PM—all because of a P.E. (Physical Education) class. 
    <sup><b>12</b></sup>Those days were so much fun—until the time came when we were told that classes would be suspended for two weeks. 
    <sup><b>13</b></sup>But those two weeks turned into a year or even two because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
    <sup><b>14</b></sup>That time was incredibly boring, especially since we were already in Grade 10 until Grade 11, and all we had were online classes and modules. 
    <sup><b>15</b></sup>I really missed face-to-face classes because we were just stuck at home, staring at our phones and computers all day. 
    <sup><b>16</b></sup>Although some of my friends and classmates would come over to use the WiFi and we would play mobile games to pass the time, it was still boring in the end. 
    <sup><b>17</b></sup>After that, we finally reached Grade 12, and face-to-face classes were brought back, though not fully implemented since the virus was still around. 
    <sup><b>18</b></sup>One of the best things about Grade 12 was that I got to be classmates again with one of my closest friends, who remains my best friend to this day. 
    <sup><b>19</b></sup>Overall, my Grade 12 experience was enjoyable, though there was a fair amount of stress due to the heavy workload—especially with research projects. 
    <sup><b>20</b></sup>That was my high school life—sometimes fun, sometimes challenging, but overall, it remained a happy experience because of my friends who were always there for me.

            <h2>College Years</h2>
<p align="justify">
    <sup><b>1</b></sup>College life in Manila turned out to be way harder than I expected. 
    <sup><b>2</b></sup>I enrolled at the University of the East (UE) as a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student. 
    <sup><b>3</b></sup>The first thing that shocked me was the tuition fee—₱50K+ for just the first semester of first year. 
    <sup><b>4</b></sup>Despite the challenges, I experienced a lot and quickly made friends along the way. 
    <sup><b>5</b></sup>However, I soon realized that college subjects are no joke. 
    <sup><b>6</b></sup>Aside from the programming and coding tasks, I also had to be good at math, which made things even more difficult. 
    <sup><b>7</b></sup>Commuting became one of the biggest challenges for me. 
    <sup><b>8</b></sup>I often woke up late, and the traffic in Manila made everything worse. 
    <sup><b>9</b></sup>Even though my school was somewhat close to where I lived, the long commute meant I had to adjust my schedule just to make sure I wouldn’t be late. 
    <sup><b>10</b></sup>It really tested my patience and time management skills. 

    <sup><b>11</b></sup>I did manage to make some close friends in my section. 
    <sup><b>12</b></sup>Even though we now live in different areas, we're still friends to this day. 
    <sup><b>13</b></sup>Despite the distance, we’ve managed to stay connected and continue supporting each other. 
    <sup><b>14</b></sup>During my college journey, I also experienced homesickness. 
    <sup><b>15</b></sup>At times, it felt like I was still stuck in the COVID-19 days, like I was always confined and disconnected from the world outside. 
    <sup><b>16</b></sup>I really missed my friends back in the province and my parents, whom I could only video call when they weren’t busy. 
    <sup><b>17</b></sup>Now, I’m already in my 2nd year of college. 
    <sup><b>18</b></sup>I’m doing my best to keep up with the flow of life. 
    <sup><b>19</b></sup>I hope that I can still learn a lot from college. 
    <sup><b>20</b></sup>I want to experience many more things as I continue this journey.
